Communication
=============

Communication for the Zope Toolkit development itself happens both
on IRC and in a mailing list.

IRC
---

We use #zope on the IRC network provided by `freenode.net
<http://www.freenode.net>`_.


.. _mailing-list:


Weekly IRC meeting
------------------

The Zope developer community gathers every Tuesday at 15:00 to 15:30 UTC on
#zope to discuss current matters.

Agendas and summaries of the meetings are sent to the zope-dev mailing list.


Mailing list
------------

The official Zope Toolkit development mailing list is
zope-dev@zope.org. You can subscribe to it by visiting
http://mail.zope.org/mailman/listinfo/zope-dev.

.. note::
    In the earlier days of Zope 3 development we used to have a
    separate mailing list for development on Zope 3
    (zope3-dev@zope.org). This list was merged into the general
    zope-dev@zope.org list a while ago.
