Proposals for new functionality
===============================

.. note::
    This part of the development process is not yet followed.


Proposals are a semi-formal way to write down our ideas for new functionality
and larger changes to the code base and process. They are discussed and then
get accepted or denied by the developers. We keep them available for
historical reference.

Proposals are tracked in Launchpad: https://blueprints.launchpad.net/zopetoolkit/

Note: General proposals for the toolkit need to be registered within the
"zopetoolkit-project" on Launchpad.

Detailed specifications of proposals are placed in the developer documentation
which can be edited by checking out
svn+ssh://svn.zope.org/repos/main/zopetoolkit/doc and adding a separate page
in the "Proposals" section.

You should point the blueprint's external URL to the corresponding page
generated on http://docs.zope.org/zopetoolkit.
