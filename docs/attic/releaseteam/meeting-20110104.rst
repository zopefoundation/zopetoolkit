Discussion
----------

* ccomb plans the release BlueBream 1.0 "final" soon.

* z3c.recipe.compattest has been released and runs again in a virtualenv.

* A planning is made for the ZTK-1.1 release. Since a Grok release is on the
  horizon, it makes sense to do a ZTK-1.1 next week. j-w will announce this
  plan to zope-dev. hannosch will write a high-level changelog for ZTK-1.1.

* Since a lot of zope.app.* packages have been deprecated from the ZTK, the
  ones that are still part of the ZTK are discussed and zope.app.appsetup in
  particular. Both BB and Grok use this package, even though Grok is
  investigating how to move the policy defined in zope.app.appsetup to the Grok
  codebase.

* The plan was crystalized to indeed do a ZTK-1.1 release on Tuesday January
  11th.

Tasks
-----

Next meeting
