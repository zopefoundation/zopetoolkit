Proposals for new functionality
===============================

Proposals are a semi-formal way to write down our ideas for new
functionality and larger changes to the code base. They are discussed
and then get accepted (so somebody might be free to implement them) or
denied. We keep them available for historical reference.

The first place we gathered proposals was our wiki on the proposals
page: http://wiki.zope.org/zope3/Proposals

At some point we also started tracking their status in Launchpad using
the blueprint system: https://blueprints.launchpad.net/zope3/
