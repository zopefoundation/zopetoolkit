Zope Toolkit
============

The Zope Toolkit (ZTK) is a set of libraries intended for reuse by projects to
develop web applications or web frameworks. It is developed by the
contributors of the Zope Foundation.

The whole collection of ZTK libraries are used in various web
frameworks and web application servers. Three of these are managed by
the Zope project: Zope 2, Zope 3 and Grok. If you install one of these
systems, you will get the ZTK along with it automatically.

The :ref:`steering-group` is there to help guide the development
of the ZTK.

.. note::
    Currently some of the ZTK libraries are more reusable 
    than others, but we are working on getting them all in shape.

    The ZTK is not by installable by itself directly, but its libraries
    are.
