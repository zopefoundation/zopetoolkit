History of the Zope Toolkit
===========================

The Zope Toolkit started as "Zope 3". Zope 3 was the intended
successor to the Zope 2 platform. It didn't work out that way. Zope 3
can be used, but Zope 2 is still alive and well, and in fact started
to use large parts of the Zope 3 codebase. We also have the Grok
project came along that reused Zope 3 to build a related but separate
web framework.

We realized that the term "Zope 3" was overloaded, meaning both the
set of libraries shared by Zope 2 and Grok, and the actual web
application server with a user interface that you can install. We
therefore introduced the term Zope Toolkit so we could think about
this set of shared libraries independently and manage them that way.
